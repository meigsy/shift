# Python Environment Management

Always use `uv` for Python package management and environment setup:
- Use `uv sync` instead of `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Use `uv run <command>` instead of `python <command>` or `python3 <command>`
- Use `uv add <package>` instead of `pip install <package>`
- Never suggest using `venv`, `virtualenv`, or `pip` directly
- When creating Python projects, always create a `pyproject.toml` for uv

Python version: 3.11+

# Code Changes

- Do NOT write, edit, or modify code unless the user explicitly asks you to
- When in ask mode, only provide suggestions, explanations, or proposed changes as text
- Only make code changes when the user explicitly requests them (e.g., "fix this", "update that", "implement X")
- If you identify an issue, explain it and wait for the user to ask you to fix it

# General Development Principles

- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Explicit naming over clever abstractions
- Clear function and variable names
- Add comments only where clarity is needed
